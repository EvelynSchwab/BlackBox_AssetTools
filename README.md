# BlackBox Asset Tools

A collection of lightweight editor utility tools developed for an unannounced side project, BlackBox.

These tools are designed to be plugin and C++ independent to make them as modular and migratable as possible, especially for student work or projects that cannot easily add additional plugins.
The tools are intended to be added to over time as needs arise.
